## Homework 2
The purpose of this assignment was to create a personal portfolio through which we would be able to showcase our abilities to potential clients. More importantly however, we were able to practice using Bootstrap to format a website in the way that we desired and learned to render it in a way that works on tablets, phones, laptops, and other devices. 


## Motivation
One of the reasons that I want to learn web design is to bring the resources of my company to it's community in a more accessible way. The people we serve are low-income and many do not have access to computers, only tablets and phones. This activity has helped me to learn to create a responsive website that renders well on a variety of devices, thus bringing me one step closer to that goal.
